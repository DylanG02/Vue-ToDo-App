# Vue 3 + Vite

# Vue-ToDo

This is a fully functional Vue To Do list application that allows the user the create tasks and divide them into business or personal. It then provides the functionality to cross off and delete any To Do's.

## Description:

This was my first project with the Vue framework and has allowed me to get to grips with some of the basics and see how it  works. I wanted to create an app rather than just a web page to give me a more in depth understanding on some of the functionality provided in Vue.

### Features:

  - Uses local storage to hold the To Do's
  - Uses a variety of Vue methods
  - Styled to differentiate between personal and business
  - Using object orianteated programming to arrange the list of To Do's in order of time created
 
## Improvements:

To Improve this project I would add a way of making custom catergories other than just business and personal to create a more imersive application.
